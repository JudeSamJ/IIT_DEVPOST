# RANSOMWARE DETECTION FOR MALICIOUS FILES:
The machine learning model in the ransomware detection project likely involves several key components and steps, which are common in such applications. Hereâ€™s a general overview based on typical practices in machine learning for cybersecurity:

1)Data Collection: The first step involves gathering a dataset that includes both benign (non-malicious) and malicious (ransomware) files. This dataset is crucial for training the model.

2)Feature Extraction: The next step is to extract relevant features from the files. Features could include file size, file type, metadata, and behavioral characteristics (like file access patterns). This step transforms raw data into a format suitable for machine learning.

3)Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms can be used for classification tasks, such as:
        a)Decision Trees: These models split the data based on feature values to make predictions.
        b)Random Forests: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
        c)Support Vector Machines (SVM): This algorithm finds the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space.
        d)Neural Networks: These are used for more complex patterns and can be particularly effective in deep learning scenarios.

4)Training the Model: The selected model is trained using the labeled dataset (where files are marked as benign or malicious). During training, the model learns to associate specific features with the corresponding labels.

5)Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated using a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used to measure how well the model can identify ransomware.

6)Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a real-world environment to monitor files and detect potential ransomware threats in real-time.

7)Continuous Learning: The model may need to be updated regularly with new data to adapt to evolving ransomware tactics and improve its detection capabilities.
